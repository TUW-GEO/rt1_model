RT1 model documentation
-----------------------

Welcome to the documentation for the **RT1 python module**!


The `RT1` package implements a bistatic first order scattering radiative transfer model that might be used for generic purposes. 

Unique features of this model are:

- Analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation up to first order with flexible BRDF and volume phase function specifications.
- Analytical solution for the jacobian with respect to arbitrary model parameters.
- ...
- **TODO: write a nice intro**

`RT1` is provided as open-source software, hoping that it will help you in your research. 
The developers would very much appreciate to receive feedback how the model is used. Also contributions and suggestions for further improvements are highly welcome.


Please read the LICENSE agreement related to this software which gives you much flexibility to (re)use the code. Currently we use the APACHE-2.0 license.
