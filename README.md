# RT1 model - A bistatic scattering model for first order scattering of random media.

> **NOTE: This repo is a work in progress and supposed to supersede [rt1](https://github.com/TUW-GEO/rt1) soon!**

The package implements a first order scattering radiative transfer model
for random volume over ground as documented in *Quast & Wagner (2016)* and
*Quast, Albergel, Calvet, Wagner (2019)*


The documentation of the package is found [here](https://rt1-model.readthedocs.io).
